- Using the Explore design mindset
- most issues have already been solved before, experienced architects explore their catalogue of design patterns to find a solution before attempting to design something new.
- with this every pattern can be used and adapted to the specific problem spaces.
- An architecture pattern is a resuable solution to a specific problem.
- The ultimate goal of using a pattern is promote quality attributes of our system using a combination of structures
- Important to understand the difference between a design pattern and an architecture pattern
- Design patterns are a design tool regardless of abstraction. They exist for database design, user experience, testing
- Architecture patterns differ from programming design patterns (GOF)
- GOF (Gang of Four): how to organise a object-oriented program to promote reusability and maintainability
- Architecture patterns define solutions for quality attribute scenarios pertaining to design, runtime and coceptual - often dealing with multiple components
- Architecture Patterns: Layers Pattern, Ports and Adapters Pattern, Pipe and Filter Pattern, Service-Oriented Architecture, Publish-Subscribe pattern, Shared-Data Pattern,
  Multi-Tier Pattern, Center of Competence Pattern, Open Source Contribution Pattern, Big Ball of Mud Pattern
-  The Layers Pattern is an architectural design pattern that organizes software into distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility.
    - Uses Modules, each module should belong to a layer. Layers group functionally cohesive modules.
    - There is a one way relationship between layers, a higher up layer should use layers below but this relation only goes one way.
    - Cyclical dependencies are not permitted
    - each layer introduces abstraction, making it a difficult developer experience to understand abstractions between the lowest and highest levels
- Ports and Adapters Pattern
    - Also known as hexagonal architecure
    - Given because of the shape used to describe the pattern
    - having many sides or ports each of which can connect to external systems through adapters
